A Makefile is a special file used by the make build automation tool. It defines how to compile and link a program, specifying dependencies between files and the commands to build them. Makefiles help automate repetitive build tasks, ensuring only changed files are rebuilt, which saves time.

In your example
Your Makefile excerpt:

```
insert.o : src/header.h
search.o : src/header.h
files.o : src/header.h
utils.o : src/header.h

clean :
    rm -f $(objects)
```

What it does:
Dependencies:
Each .o file (object file) depends on src/header.h. This means if src/header.h changes, make knows it needs to rebuild these object files.

clean target:
The clean rule deletes all files listed in the $(objects) variable (usually object files like *.o). This is useful to remove build artifacts and start fresh.

Summary
Purpose: Automates building and cleaning your project.
How: Tracks which files depend on which, and runs commands to update them as needed.
